Ceremony information

Conan O'Brien hosted the 97th Academy Awards.
In October 2024, the Academy hired television producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan, for the second year in a row, to oversee production of the 2025 ceremony with veteran television director Hamish Hamilton selected to direct the telecast, also for the second consecutive year and his fifth time overall.[38] "We are delighted to announce the return of our incredibly dynamic and creative Oscars team, Raj, Katy, Hamish, Misty, Alana and Dave. And we are thrilled to announce the addition of the brilliant Michael Bearden," said AMPAS CEO Bill Kramer and AMPAS President Janet Yang in a press release justifying their selection of the producers. "Their love for cinema, their collective creative vision, and their unparalleled expertise in live television make them the perfect team to create an exceptional show for our global audience on the film industry's biggest night."[38] In response, Kapoor and Mullan released a statement, stating: "We are thrilled to lead the brilliant Oscars production team again and work alongside the Academy and Disney/ABC to help create an unforgettable night of television for movie lovers worldwide. We hope to continue to inspire and connect new generations to share our love for the art of filmmaking and celebrate all the incredible artists who are Oscar-nominated this year."[38]

The following month, comedian, podcaster and former talk show host Conan O'Brien was announced as host of the event.[8] Before this decision, speculation and word from reliable sources indicated the Academy was leaning toward a format with multiple hosts sharing duties throughout the show; this was floated after both Jimmy Kimmel, who hosted four times (in 2017, 2018, 2023, and 2024), and John Mulaney, who had hosted the 14th Governors Awards to much praise, both reportedly turned down the opportunity. A combo of Deadpool & Wolverine stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman were also among those buzzed to be in the mix, but Reynolds told Deadline Hollywood that it was highly unlikely though he said he would like to host it with Jackman "someday".[8][39][40] As for the production team, returning to the telecast are Rob Paine as co-executive producer, Taryn Hurd and Sarah Levine Hall as producers, Mandy Moore as supervising choreographer, and Bob Dickinson and Noah Mitz as lighting designers; producers Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney, long-time collaborators of O'Brien, join the team for the first time. Collaborating with O'Brien as writers are Amberia Allen, José Arroyo, Josh Comers, Dan Cronin, Jessie Gaskell, Skyler Higley, Berkley Johnson, Ian Karmel, Brian Kiley, Laurie Kilmartin, Carol Leifer, Jon Macks, Matt O'Brien, Agathe Panaretos, and Sweeney.[41]

In February 2025, the Academy announced that the telecast would not include past acting winners presenting the nominees for the acting categories.[42] This format, dubbed as the "Fab 5", first used in 2009 and featuring five previous winners praising one acting nominee each, was brought back in 2024 after a fifteen-year absence.[43] Instead, it was used for categories to highlight below-the-line talent, with notable actors speaking out about the contributions of the nominees behind the scenes of their craft. For the acting categories, the previous ceremony's acting winners appeared as presenters and read the nominees for a category.[42][43][44]

For the third year in a row, the ceremony featured a special tribute to the James Bond franchise, in this case to honor longtime franchise producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson following being honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for "their contribution to the industry's theatrical landscape".[45] The artists Doja Cat, Lisa, and Raye teamed up to perform "Live and Let Die", "Diamonds Are Forever", and "Skyfall", respectively, with Halle Berry (a former Bond girl) introducing the tribute and Margaret Qualley dancing to the James Bond Theme.[46][47][48]

For the second year in a row, Amelia Dimoldenberg returned as the social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent.[49] The ceremony, for the first time, was streamed live on Hulu and internationally on Disney+.[6][50][51] The Hulu stream was notably met with technical issues, crashing multiple times throughout the ceremony, and prematurely ending the stream just before the Best Actress nominees were announced; Hulu apologized the following day.[52][53][54] A half-hour launch special of the next season of American Idol aired immediately following ABC's telecast.[55]

Adrien Brody, who won Best Actor for The Brutalist, delivered the longest acceptance speech in Oscars history. He spoke for 5 minutes and 40 seconds; 10 seconds longer than Greer Garson's Best Actress speech for Mrs. Miniver (1942).[56]

Impact of Los Angeles wildfires
See also: January 2025 Southern California wildfires § Entertainment and sports industries
Voting for the nearly 10,000 Academy members opened on January 8, 2025, and was originally set to close on January 12, but due to the Southern California wildfires, the deadline for Oscar nomination voting was extended to January 17. The nominations announcement, originally scheduled to be announced on January 17, was delayed to January 23.[57][58][59]

Changes to the ceremony itself would also occur in the wake of the wildfires, with the Academy choosing to honor the Los Angeles community and its role in the film industry. As part of this shift, it was announced that the five musical pieces nominated for Best Original Song would not be performed live, and instead the songwriters will be highlighted through personal reflections and behind-the-scenes insight from the creative teams behind the music.[60] In response, the Society of Composers & Lyricists urged the Academy to walk back its decision. A letter was sent to the Academy's CEO, president and board of governors, as well as to the producers of the telecast; the Academy declined to comment.[61] During a virtual panel discussion for the Songwriters Hall of Fame in which all the songwriter nominees were in attendance, Diane Warren (nominated for "The Journey" from The Six Triple Eight) deemed the decision "extremely disrespectful". She added: "We've all written songs that are really integral to the movies they're in. And to me, it's unfair to both the nominees and the audience out there to not be able to hear them."[62]

In January 2025, addressing how the wildfires would affect preparation of the ceremony and his position as host, O'Brien told The Hollywood Reporter: "It's not the easiest assignment I've ever had, but I'm embracing it. And it's not about me, obviously. This is a moment for all of us to step back and say, 'Be humble.' Just be humble and say, 'This is a massive moment. This is a terrible thing that's happened in Los Angeles' ... The strategy is my writers and I, and the team that I'm working with at the Oscars, who are fantastic, the producers, everyone, we've got all of our sensors out."[63] That same month, O'Brien further expanded on his process amid the tragedies, speaking with ABC News on Good Morning America, stating: "There's a lot that's happening nationally that people are very tense about and it changes day to day. And so my job right now with my writers is to create possibilities ... That's what we're doing. We're working hard to create possibilities."[64]

Ratings and reception
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 19.7 million people over its length, marking a 1% increase from the previous year's ceremony. That total, which comes from a combination of Nielsen's measurement of linear viewers on ABC plus livestreams on Hulu, indicates a five-year viewership increase. Moreover, it had the highest rating among adults age 18–49 this awards season with a 4.54 rating, up 19% from last year. When isolated to adults 18–34, it was the highest-rated Academy Awards in five years with a 3.17 rating.[3]

In Memoriam

Quincy Jones tribute
Several presentations after the In Memoriam montage, and prior to the presentation of the last four awards, an individual tribute to Quincy Jones was presented by Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey. After their remarks, Queen Latifah performed "Ease on Down the Road" from The Wiz (the second Wiz song performed at the ceremony); Jones had been the music producer for the film version.[23][65][68]
