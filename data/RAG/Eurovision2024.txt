The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 was the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Malmö, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 2023 contest with the song "Tattoo" by Loreen. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT), the contest was held at the Malmö Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals, on 7 and 9 May, and a final on 11 May 2024. The three live shows were presented by Petra Mede and Malin Åkerman, with Mede having previously taken on the role in 2013 and 2016.

Thirty-seven countries participated in the contest, the same number as in 2023. Romania opted not to participate, and Luxembourg competed for the first time since 1993. The Netherlands was disqualified from the contest between the second semi-final and the final, but the country retained its right to vote. The inclusion of Israel among the participants in the context of the Gaza war was met with controversy, and additional security measures were put in place for the event.

The winner was Switzerland with the song "The Code", performed by the Swiss singer Nemo and written by them with Benjamin Alasu, Lasse Midtsian Nymann, and Linda Dale. Switzerland won the combined vote and jury vote, and placed fifth in the televote. Croatia won the televote and finished in second place, its best result to date as an independent country. Ukraine, France, and Israel completed the top five.

The EBU reported that the contest had a television audience of 163 million viewers in 37 European markets, an increase of a million viewers from the previous edition, with an additional 7.3 million viewers online on YouTube.[1]

The 2024 contest took place in Malmö, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 2023 contest with the song "Tattoo", performed by Loreen.[2] It was the seventh time Sweden had hosted the contest, having previously done so in 1975, 1985, 1992, 2000, 2013, and 2016. The venue for the contest was the 15,500-seat Malmö Arena, which had previously hosted the contest in 2013.[3]

The Malmö Live event centre hosted several events related to the contest. It was the venue for the "Turquoise Carpet" event on 5 May 2024, where the contestants and their delegations[b] were presented before accredited press and fans, and the opening and closing ceremonies.[5][6] The venue also hosted screenings of the live shows,[7] and was the location of the EuroClub, which hosted the official after-parties and private performances by contest participants.

A Eurovision Village was created in Folkets Park [sv]. It hosted performances by contest participants[c] and local artists, as well as screenings of the live shows for the general public. A "Eurovision Street" was established on Friisgatan [sv], stretching from Triangeln station to the Eurovision Village in Folkets Park.[6][9] Planned street music performances were affected by the withdrawal of several artists due to Israel's participation in the contest and were ultimately transferred to the Eurovision Village for security reasons.[10][11][12] The Euro Fan Café, organised by the fan organisation OGAE, was located at Amiralen [sv].[6][13][14]

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of ABBA's victory at the contest in 1974 with "Waterloo", which was also Sweden's first win, a special ABBA World exhibition was held at Södergatan [sv] between 29 April and 12 May 2024.[15]

After Sweden's win in the 2023 contest, the municipalities of Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Eskilstuna, Jönköping, Örnsköldsvik, Partille and Sandviken expressed interest in hosting the 2024 edition.[16] Host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT) set a deadline of 12 June 2023 for interested cities to formally apply.[17] By 13 June, it had received bids from Stockholm,[18] Gothenburg,[17] Malmö,[19] and Örnsköldsvik.[20] On 7 July, Gothenburg and Örnsköldsvik's bids were eliminated.[21] Later that day, the EBU and SVT announced Malmö as the host city.[2][22]
