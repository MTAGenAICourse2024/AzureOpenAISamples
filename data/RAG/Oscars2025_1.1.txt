Winners and nominees
The nominees for the 97th Academy Awards were announced on January 23, 2025, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, by actress Rachel Sennott and actor Bowen Yang.[14]

With 13 nominations, Emilia Pérez received the most Academy Award nominations for a non-English-language film.[15] For her performance in the film, Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón became the first openly transgender performer to be nominated for an acting category.[16] This is the first year two films were nominated for both Best Picture and Best International Feature Film—Emilia Pérez and I'm Still Here, with the latter becoming the first Portuguese-language film to be nominated for Best Picture.[17][18]

Flow became the second animated film to receive nominations for both Best Animated Feature and Best International Feature Film after Flee (2021).[19] Memoir of a Snail became the second R-rated animated film to be nominated for Best Animated Feature after Anomalisa (2015).[20]

The Best Director nominees were all first-time nominees in the category. The last time an entirely new lineup of nominees competed in the director race was in 1998.[17] Sound mixer Andy Nelson received his 25th nomination for Wicked, second only to John Williams (with 54) for the most nominations for a living person.[17] Sean Baker's four wins (for Anora) tied with Walt Disney for most Oscars won by a person in the same year.[12][21][22][23]

Zoe Saldaña (for Emilia Pérez) became the first American of Dominican origin to win an Oscar, winning for Best Supporting Actress.[24] Best Documentary Feature Film recipient No Other Land became the first Palestinian film to win an Academy Award,[25] with its co-director Basel Adra becoming the first Palestinian filmmaker to win an Oscar.[26] Paul Tazewell (for Wicked) became the first Black man, and the second Black costume designer overall after Ruth E. Carter (for Black Panther and its sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), to win Best Costume Design.[27][28][29]

By winning Best International Feature Film, I'm Still Here became the first Brazilian film to win an Oscar.[30][31] Flow became the first independent animated film and the first animated film without dialogue to win Best Animated Feature, with director Gints Zilbalodis and co-producer Matīss Kaža becoming the first Latvians to win an Academy Award. This marks the first time a non-Disney/Pixar film won the category for three consecutive years (the other two winners being Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio and The Boy and the Heron).[32]
